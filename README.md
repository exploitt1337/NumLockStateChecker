# NumLock Status Checker

The NumLock Status Checker is a simple batch script that helps you determine whether the NumLock key on your keyboard is enabled or disabled. This can be especially useful if your keyboard lacks a NumLock LED indicator or if it's not functioning properly.

The script uses PowerShell to query the state of the NumLock key.

## Usage

1. Save the script provided in a file with a `.bat` extension. For example, `CheckNumLock.bat`.

2. Double-click the `.bat` file to run the script.

3. The script will display whether the NumLock key is currently **enabled** or **disabled** on your keyboard.
